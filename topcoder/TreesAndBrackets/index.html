<h3>In case Topcoder's servers are down</h3>

Here is a summary of the problem:

<UL>
<LI> You can define a tree with a string of parentheses -- <tt>"()"</tt> represents a 
     leaf node, and <tt>"(<i>ABC</i>)"</tt> represents a tree with three subtrees, <i>A</i>,
     <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>.
<LI> You are given strings of two trees, <i>t1</i> and <i>t2</i>.
<LI> You want to decide whether you can convert <i>t1</i> to <i>t2</i> by repeatedly deleting
     leaf nodes from <i>t1</i>.
<LI> If it's possible to do this conversion, return "Possible".
<LI> Otherwise, return "Impossible".
<LI> The strings that you are passed will be legal, and topcoder caps their size at 100.
     My tests cap their size at 200,000.

<h2>Hints</h2>
When I first did this problem, it destroyed me.  
I'm glad, for the sake of my self-esteem, that I didn't do this
one live during a tournament.  My original writeup went through my failed attempt and
emotional process, but upon reading it a year later, I realize that it is not a very helpful
writeup.  I include it at the end of this writeup, in case you want to commune with me for
making a problem much harder than it needs to be....
<p>
Back to this problem.  There are a few key observations to make here that end up simplifying
this problem:
<h3>Observations</h3>
<b>Observation #1</b>: While the problem description talks about deleting leaf nodes, in reality,
you are deleting subtrees of T1 to match T2.  Let's draw out example 3:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=10>
<td valign=top align=center><i>t1</i><p><img src=T1.jpg height=150></td>
<td valign=top align=center><i>t2</i><p><img src=T2.jpg height=106></td></table></center><p>

It should be pretty clear that you can make <i>t1</i> match <i>t2</i> by deleting the blue nodes.
Let's make a beefier example below.  Again, you can make <i>t1</i> match <i>t2</i> by deleting the blue
nodes, and now, instead of deleting nodes, you are actually deleting trees.  I've labeled
the subtrees of the root for explanation later.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=10>
<td valign=top align=center><i>t1</i><p><img src=T3.jpg height=150></td>
<td valign=top align=center><i>t2</i><p><img src=T4.jpg height=150></td></table></center><p>

<b>Observation #2</b>: When you are matching <i>t1</i> and <i>t2</i>, you cannot delete the root nodes.
This is because you delete subtrees of <i>t1</i>.  If you delete the root of <i>t1</i>, then you will
have deleted the entire subtree.
<p>

<b>Observation #3</b>: If <i>t1</i> is a single node, and <i>t2</i> is not, then <i>t1</i> will not match <i>t2</i>.  That is the case if you try to match <i>a1</i> and <i>b1</i> above.

<b>Observation #4</b>: If <i>t2</i> is a single node, and <i>t1</i> is not empty, then <i>t1</i> will match <i>t2</i>.  That's
because you can delete all of <i>t1</i> except for the root, and then it matches <i>t2</i>.<p>

<b>Observation #5</b>: Let us suppose now that <i>t1</i> and <i>t2</i> are not single nodes.  Each of them
is the root of an ordered collection of subtrees.  Let's call <i>t1</i>'s subtrees <i>a1</i>, <i>a2</i>, ... and
<i>t2</i>'s subtrees <i>b1</i>, <i>b2</i>, ...  If <i>a1</i> matches <i>b1</i>, then you can delete both subtrees, and solve
the problem on the remaining subtrees.  You can see this illustrated in the top example, where
the two leftmost subtrees of <i>t1</i> and <i>t2</i> match.  Therefore, you can delete them, and move on.
In that example, you match each subtree in that manner, and conclude that the two trees match.
<p>

<b>Observation #6</b>: Let us suppose now <i>a1</i> and <i>b1</i> don't match.  Then, you delete <i>a1</i>, and
try again.  Looking at the beefier example above, we can do the following to show that the
trees match:

<UL>
<LI> <i>a1</i> and <i>b1</i> don't match, so delete <i>a1</i>.
<LI> <i>a2</i> and <i>b1</i> match, so delete both.
<LI> <i>a3</i> and <i>b2</i> don't match, so delete <i>a3</i>.
<LI> <i>a4</i> and <i>b2</i> match, so delete both.
<LI> <i>a5</i> and <i>b3</i> don't match, so delete <i>a3</i>.
<LI> <i>a6</i> and <i>b3</i> match, so delete both.
<LI> At this point, <i>t2</i> is a single node, so you can conclude that <i>t1</i> and <i>t2</i> match.
</UL>

<hr>
<h3>Turning the observations into a solution</h3>

We're not going to delete anything.  We're not even going to bother representing the problem
as a tree.  Instead, we're going to create the following two vectors:

<UL>
<LI> <b>M1</b> is a vector where <b>M1[i]</b> is the index of the opening or closing character for <b>t1[i]</b>.
<LI> <b>M2</b> is the same vector, but for <b>t2</b>.
</UL>

In example 3, we have:

<pre>
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
t1:  (  (  (  )  )  (  (  (  )  )  (  )  )  (  )  )
M1: 15  4  3  2  1 12  9  8  7  6 11 10  5 14 13  0

t2:  (  (  )  (  (  )  )  (  )  )
M2:  9  2  1  6  5  4  3  8  7  0
</pre>

You can create these vectors using a <b>deque</b> like a stack: push the index when you see '(', 
and pop the index when you see ')'.  When you pop the index, you can set two elements of <b>M1</b>.
Go ahead and write the code for this right now, and test it.
<p>
Store these vectors as part of the class, and then write the following method:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
bool match(int i1, int i2) const;   <font color=blue>// This returns true if the subtree rooted at i1 in t1</font>
                                    <font color=blue>// matches the the subtree rooted at i2 in t2</font>
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Your <b>check()</b> method will call <b>match(0,0)</b> to solve the problem.
<p>
Use the observations above to write <b>match()</b>.  To wit:

<UL>
<LI> If the subtree rooted at i2 is a single node (in other words, <b>M2[i2]</b> equals <b>(i2+1)</b>, return true.
<LI> If the subtree rooted at i1 is a single node, return false.
<LI> Otherwise, you are going to run through the subtrees.  You'll note that the first subtree of
     i1 is indices i1+1 through <b>M1[i1+1]</b>.  The next subtree, if there is one, starts
     at index <b>M1[i1+1]+1</b>, and you use <b>M1</b> find its ending index.  And so on.
<LI> Let's call the subtree of t1 <b>a</b> and the subtree of t2 <b>b</b>.  Call <i>match()</i>
     recursively on the two subtrees.  If it returns true, you'll move both <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>
     to the next subtrees.  If it returns false, you'll only move <b>a</b>.
</UL>

Below, I have put print statements into my program so that you can see the two vectors, and
all of the recursive calls.  I've also added
example 5 as the "beefier" example above, and I've annotated the output so that you can see
how the <b>match()</b> calls correspond to the picture above.
<p>
But before that, what's the running time?  Well, if you think about it, we only visit every
node of t1 once, and for each of those, we visit exactly one node of t2.  The answer
is <i>O(|t1|)</i>.

<h3>My original writeup, which is not overly helpful</h3>

Let me describe for you how I went about this one:
<p>
First, I thought, <i>Let's try a simple dynamic program on <b><i>t1</i></b>.  I'll check to see if 
<b><i>t1</i></b> equals <b><i>t2</i></b> .  If so, return "Possible".  Next, I'll check if they don't equal each other, but
they are the same size.  If so, return "Impossible".  Finally, I'll run through <b><i>t1</i></b>, and each time
I see "()", I'll call <b>check()</b> recursively on a string made from <b><i>t1</i></b> with the "()" removed.
Memoize and submit.</i>  
<p>
The good news with this is that it worked with all of the examples.  The bad news is that I 
had a haunting feeling about its running time.
Let's reason through it -- suppose that <b><i>t1</i>.size()</b>
is 100.  Then <b><i>t1</i></b> represents a tree with 50 nodes.  If the tree is complete, then its 
bottom row has 25 nodes, and we can potentially have <i>2<sup>25</sup></i> different settings
of keeping and deleting those nodes.  It's too expensive.  But, I thought, "Maybe it will
be fast enough...."  To check, I hastily created test
case number six in <b>main.cpp</b>, with a string where <b><i>t1</i></b> had 
100 characters.  The code looked like this:

<pre>
  if (atoi(argv[1]) == 6) {
    <i>t1</i> = "(((())((())())())((())((())())())((())((())())())((())((())())())((())((())())())((())((())())())())";
    <i>t1</i> = "((())((())())())";
    <i>t2</i> = "((()()()()()))";
  }
</pre>

You'll notice that I didn't delete the line <b><i>t1</i> = "((())((())())())";</b> that I had
copied from test case 4, 
so I wasn't actually testing the big case.  When it ran blazingly fast, I submitted, and failed 
the system test on the time limit.  Below is the failing case from the system test, -- I turned it into
case 7 in <b>main.cpp</b>:

<pre>
  if (atoi(argv[1]) == 7) {
    <i>t1</i> = "((()(()()((()()(()(()((()(((()(())())()())()())())()())())()))()()))()))"; 
    <i>t2</i> = "(((()(((((((()()())())())())()))))))";
  }
</pre>

Crap.  In the back of my mind, I knew that was a bad solution.  I was lazy, and got what
I deserved.  It's a pity -- sometimes, lazy works...
<p>
I then thought, maybe if I convert the strings into two <b>unit64_t</b>'s each, I can 
represent '(' with 0 and ')' with 1, and then delete the "()" strings using bit operations.
That will probably speed my code up by a factor of 100, so maybe it will be fast enough.
60 lines later and more minutes than I care to divulge, I decided that I didn't want to 
implement what amounts to 128-bit bit shifting and masking on vectors of <b>uint64_t</b>'s,
and typed a bunch of d's into my vi window.
<p>
Ego bruised, I went back to the drawing board, and realized that for this to work, the
top node of <b><i>t1</i></b> has to correspond to the top node of <b><i>t2</i></b>.  Let's suppose that
the top node of <b><i>t1</i></b> has three children, and the top node of <b><i>t2</i></b> has two.  
Then either the first child of <b><i>t1</i></b> has to match the 
first child of <b><i>t2</i></b>, or the second child of <b><i>t1</i></b> has to match the first child
of <b><i>t2</i></b>.  Whichever of those matches, one of the remaining children of <b><i>t1</i></b> has
to match the second child of <b><i>t2</i></b>. 
<p>
We get the following algorithm:
<p>
<pre>
   int match(root-of-subtree-in-<i>t1</i>, root-of-subtree-in-<i>t2</i>)
   {
     if (root-of-subtree-in-<i>t2</i> has no children) return 1;
     if (root-of-subtree-in-<i>t1</i> has no children) return 0;
     return sibling_match(<i>t1</i>'s-children, <i>t2</i>'s-children);
   }

   int sibling_match(siblings-in-<i>t1</i>, siblings-in-<i>t2</i>)
   {
     int i, j;
 
     i = 0;
     j = 0;
     while(1) {
       if (j == siblings-in-<i>t2</i>.size()) return 1;
       if (i == siblings-in-<i>t1</i>.size()) return 0;
       if (match(sibling-i-in-<i>t1</i>, sibling-j-in-<i>t2</i>)) {
         i++;
         j++;
       } else {
         i++;
       }
     }
   }

That's actually not too bad of an algorithm, but I hadn't really wrapped my mind around
it, so I wrote only <b>sibling_match()</b>, and made it work without <b>match()</b>.  Moreover, I didn't
know how to represent my graphs, so I defined a node as follows:

<pre>
class node {
  public:
    vector &lt;node *&gt; children;
};
</pre>

And I converted the strings to this format with a recursive procedure.  In <b>check</b>, I 
called <b>sibling_match(<i>t1</i>root->children, <i>t2</i>root->children)</b>.  It took well over a half hour
to code up, but it worked -- damn that was a pain!  I went to the Topcoder writeup and saw that the problem
had over 50% success rate, and the average correct time was 20 minutes.  And the problem was
labeled "Dynamic Program" and "String Manipulation."  WTF?  
<p>
I slept on it.
<p>
I lied in the bed the next morning, and thought, "What if I simply work on the strings?"
I can create a vector <b>M1</b>, such that <b>M1[i]</b> equals the mate to letter <i>i</i>
in <b><i>t1</i></b>.  For example, if <b><i>t1</i></b> is "(()())", then <b>M1</b> will be 
{ 5, 2, 1, 4, 2, 0 }.  Then, I can specify a subtree rooted at character <i>i</i> 
in <b><i>t1</i></b> with <i>(i,<b>M[i]</b>)</i>.  And I can represent a group of siblings with
the index of the first '(', and the index of the last ')'.  I put the two strings into
the class definition, and now I could write 
<b>match()</b> and <b>sibling_match()</b> above by simply calling them with indices 
representing the two subtrees/sets-of-siblings.
<p>
It was still 93 lines of code, but I wrote it quickly, and as it passed the system test
on the first try, I felt slightly better about myself.
<p>
See if you can give it a try!
